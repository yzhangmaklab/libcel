1. Simulated Intensities (library/reference): Intensity_1 to Intensity_1123

(a). Intensity_1 to Intensity_1100 are intensities for twisted structures
     100 twisted for each shape, total 11 shapes.
(b). Intensity_1101 to Intensity_1111 are intensities for untwisted structures for 
     11 shapes using lattice constant (a=7.78, b=8.20).
(c). Intensity_1112 to Intensity_1122 are intensities for untwisted structures for 
     11 shapes using lattice constant (a=8.19, b=8.20).
(d). Intensity_1123 is intensity for amorphous structure.


2. Experimental Intensities: Intensity_control, Intensity_acid, Intensity_iron


3. R is 1/d
